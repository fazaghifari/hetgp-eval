## Implemented Methods
* Most Likely Heteroscedastic GP (MLHGP): https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1273496.1273546
* Heteroscedastic SVGP: https://gpflow.github.io/GPflow/2.9.1/notebooks/advanced/heteroskedastic.html 
  * The model seems to be not performing well with low data sample (Idk what's wrong)
